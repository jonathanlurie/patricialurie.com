Yoga and me

Since I remember I was looking for a perfect form of physical activity. I tried judo, volleyball and athletics but I felt something was missing. I used to think yoga was not for me. How someone as sportive and active like me could enjoy calm and meditative practice? Still, once I tried yoga, I could not stop…

What is so special about yoga?
For me it is kind of  a mystery how from the centuries yoga practice changes minds and bodies of people all over the world. What I love the most about it is the sensation of a complete concentration (dharana, where the brain is so busy checking the alignment of every element of practitioner’s body, where every neuron and each synapse work hard to achieve the asana’s goal) leading to the state of meditation (dhyana).

Who am I?
I come from Warsaw, Poland, where I started to practice asana in 2006, in Joga Foksal school. First five years of my experience lie deeply in BKS Iyengar tradition. For following four years I developed my individual practice. I started to follow hatha vinyasa sessions more than one year ago. Finally, tired of science, I decided to change my profession and follow 200h yoga teachers’ training in Le studio de yoga Wanderlust in Montreal, Canada. For more than ten years now, yoga is my real passion that has very important place in my every day life as I practice or teach each day.
